## MobileBook
The live coding project aim to build a simple Web App with React TypeScript. 

## The Challenge
In next 60 minutes, you will be developing the solution to:
### 1. Fetch and handle Data from a REST API
Mock data are available from the API:
https://randomuser.me/api/?results=60

### 2. Render a list of profile cards
Make it similar with design wireframe, by any styles you like and beleive to fit the screen. 
 - Design wireframe: ```/.designs/mobilebook-ui-design-main-view.png```
Each user card should include Avatar, Name, City, Email and Phone number. 

### 3. (Bonus feature) Filter profile cards list by searching name or city
While user type in the Search input field, the list will update based on the input string, to filter results of the list. 

#### *notes
You can choose from any of above requirements to start with. Be sure to utilise TypeScript for the solution. The design wireframe just for illustration, you can style your elements in any color / styles you think that fits the screen for a good UX, and think about accessibility. Good luck!
